# RFCs Clarified
This project is an experiment to use GitHub to update and clarify Internet standard documents.

Strategy:
1. Help RFC readers to read the documents faster
2. Help RFC readers to understand the documents more easily and avoid errors in learning
3. Help RFC readers focus on parts that are important to them and skip irrelevant parts
4. Produce excellent examples that authors of new RFCs can follow
5. Help more people participate in the standards process

Tactics:
1. Propose individual changes as public GitHub issues, open to public and anonymous comment.
2. Move proposed changes forward on a slow but well-defined timeline.
    This allows people time to discover the discussion and raise important points.
3. Merge errata into RFC documents.
4. Reformat into a modern format: Markdown
5. Remove parts that implementors have rejected.  This applies only to mature technologies.
6. Remove parts that are obsolete and introduce security vulnerabilities
7. Remove parts that are obsolete and superseded
8. Rewrite examples in modern languages or pseudocode
9. Re-organize documents
10. Add reference implementations and data files
11. Link to related non-RFC content.  Keep an archive of those pages.

Over time, we will evolve the process.
We wish it to become as effective as the [Rust RFC process](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/).
